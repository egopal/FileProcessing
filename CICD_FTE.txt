
EXPECTATION:

Ensure the project release is tested through Jenkin.


TO RUN TESTS FOR THE FIRST TIME
===============================
Requirements:
	1) Understanding of Git Command
	2) Knowledge of BB 
	3) Jenkins and Login access to Jenkins (all four)
	4) JIRA and the knowledge on where the Performance Tickets can be created. (Q)
	5) Ensure you have JIRA ticket for the Performance Test, if not create one.
Project Setup in BB:
    1)Verify EPE repository name (aaa.bbb.ccc) consists of
        a) Portfolio name in the first section
        b) BB DEV Project name in the second section
		c) BB Repository name in the third section.
		   Normally, the third section may not be same, meaning the DEV repository name and EPE mapping may not be the same.
		   The best approach is to create a folder in EPE repository with the same name of BB DEV repository.
Ensure Test assets are in the Branch:
	1)Verify the Branch is created with tag as
	    release/23.08.10
		the word release is required followed by /
		the release number is the release that being supported, it is the same name that of dev release branch
		if the release is moved and a different branch is created, create a same branch here.
	2)Verify the following directory and files exists under the release branch
	    a) main directory such as web, services or edi, etc.
		b) at the same level we have files such as
		      .gitignore - this is the first file that gets uploaded to BB.
			             - this file contains list of files, not to be allowed to the repository while committing to the repository.
			  Jenkinsfile- this file contains arguments for build and emails.
              config-regressiontest.yml
                         - this file should contain information for test id and test instance id for executing the test.
                         - the value given for duration is supposed to override test duration						 
Initiate a Test from BB:
1)  Make a simple change and commit the file and push on the remote server. This will effect a Test execution.
    You can modify the JenkinsFile, changing or adding an email id or adding a comment.
2)  Go to Jenkins to see the Test and you can cross check in LRE with the run id (that the test is running)
3)  You can check the results status in Jenkins
4)  Test results are Emailed with link and as well as link to download the html results file in .zip format


TO RE-RUN THE TESTS FROM Jenkins
================================

1)  Login to Jenkins (out of 4, identify the one it belongs to you)
2)  Go To the Jenkins repository
3)  Execute the Test manually
4)  FOLLOW STEPS 3 and 4 from above.


RUN REGRESSION TESTS USING SCHEDULED JOBS
=========================================
Modification is in progress.

CICD TESTS
===========
The Tests can be invoked after the code is deployed in Stage, as Post-deploy action.
To Enable the CICD, the post-deploy action should have entries to call repository/branch to execute the test.
This is managed with the help of Tools team.
When you upload the CICD Implementation page, Jeremy pickup the change and add CICD call.
No need to do anything right now, Focus on project onboard to Jenkins.
			  
			  

			  
		   exist with the same name, if not the project directory is created and all the scripts are grouped.
      The with Jenkins

mistakes in naming - already exists

Branch
why Branch in bsc?
config file? to support all kinds of testing using LRE, tomorrow you may not need it if the tool changes.
mistakes in Branching
Branch concept / How it works
Merging
We always go with Final script / When you need version control? if you want to go back to script? 
Key File - Version Control on those files are important
commits in BB - effect

 
LRE
we have a scenario.. 
how a scenario is called?
Just an engine
do you need version control for scripts in LRE? No
so, branch concept exist only in BB not in LRE

Every one testing should know this.
How to know this? Artifactory / JIRA

 Test Failures
 1) when already runnings (same test cannot)
 2) different test when multiple execution
 3) happens without overlapping LG's
 
Manage
1) Branching and Testing
2) Jenkins enabled -> Add more and more repositories and complete the Jenkins enablement
3) Regression Test
4) CICD Enabled
5) Version Control Email
6) Test Status Email
